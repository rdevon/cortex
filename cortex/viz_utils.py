''' This file contains different utility functions that are not connected
in anyway to the networks presented in the tutorials, but rather help in
processing the outputs into a more understandable way.
For example ``tile_raster_images`` helps in generating a easy to grasp
image from a set of samples or weights.

    Transform an array with one flattened image per row, into an array in
    which images are reshaped and layed out like tiles on a floor.
    This function is useful for visualizing datasets whose rows are images,
    and also columns of matrices for transforming those rows
    (such as the first layer of a neural net).
    :type X: a 2-D ndarray or a tuple of 4 channels, elements of which can
    be 2-D ndarrays or None;
    :param X: a 2-D array in which every row is a flattened image.
    :type img_shape: tuple; (height, width)
    :param img_shape: the original shape of each image
    :type tile_shape: tuple; (rows, cols)
    :param tile_shape: the number of images to tile (rows, cols)
    :param output_pixel_vals: if output should be pixel values (i.e. int8
    values) or floats
    :param scale_rows_to_unit_interval: if the values need to be scaled before
    being plotted to [0,1] or not
    :returns: array suitable for viewing as an image.
    (See:`PIL.Image.fromarray`.)
    :rtype: a 2-d array with same dtype as X.
