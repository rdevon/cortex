# cortex2.0
A machine learning library for PyTorch


## SETUP
The first thing to do is to set up the config.yaml. This file is user-specific (it got tracked at some point, so I need to fix this), and will tell cortex everything user-specific regarding data locations, visualation, and outputs. Here is mine on MILA machines:

```python
torchvision_data_path: /data/milatmp1/hjelmdev/data/
data_paths: {
    Imagenet-12: /data/lisa/data/ImageNet2012_jpeg,
    CelebA: /tmp/hjelmdev/CelebA}
viz: {
    font: /usr/share/fonts/truetype/liberation/LiberationSerif-Regular.ttf,
    server: 'http://132.204.26.180'
}
out_path: /data/milatmp1/hjelmdev/outs/
```

These are as follows:

* torchvision_data_path: the path to all torchvision-specific datasets (details can be found in torchvision.datasets)
* data_paths: user-specified custom datasets. Currently, only support is for image folders (a la imagenet), but other dataset types (e.g., text) are planned in the near-future.
* vis: visdom specific arguments.
* out_path: Out path for experiment outputs

To run a simple experiment, try  
```
scripts/cortex classifier -S MNIST -n test_classifier
```

This should run a simple classifier on MNIST.

There are many command-line options in cortex:

* `-n` Name of experiment. Experiment is saved in <out_path>/<name>
* `-S` data Source (from torchvision or user-specified in config.yaml)
* `-r` Reload model (takes the .t7 file as the argument)
* `-a` Arguments. This is a `,`-delimited string. For instance, to increase the training epochs on the above example and use sgd, this should work: `python main.py classifier -S MNIST -n test_classifier -a train.epochs=5000,optimizer.optimizer=sgd`
* `-c` Config (For yamls of arguments, doesn't appear to be working right now)
* `-k` Klean an experiment directory
* `-v` Verbosity of logger
* `-o` Out path (overrides `config.yaml`)
* `-t` Test mode (for evaluation purposes)
