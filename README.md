# Help wanted  
Cortex is under heavy development. It's functional, but may not fit your needs yet. If you are interested in helping, email us or submit a PR.

(some) Outstanding issues:

* Reloading models does not reload hyperparameters (they need to be specified again when reloading)
* Need custom data iterator functionality within custom models
* torchtext integration needed
* Missing unit tests

# Cortex   
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rdevon/cortex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/rdevon/cortex)

Cortex is a wrapper around Pytorch that makes training, managing, and visualizing models more convenient.

## Installation  

### Prerequisites
##### Python

     cortex is currently only tested on Python 3.5 and 3.6

##### Visdom (optional)

     $pip install visdom  

### From Source  
     $git clone https://github.com/rdevon/cortex.git
     $cd cortex
     $pip install .

### Configuration  

#### Visdom Server (optional)
Cortex has built-in visualization functionality, and currently we support only Visdom (though development for torchvision options is welcome). This is optional, but highly recommended if you wish to use visualization tools within cortex.

To get started with visdom, start a Visdom server and look for server address in the output. By default, the server's address is `http://localhost:8097`.

     $python -m visdom.server  

For more details, see https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom

#### Experiment Configuration  

The first thing to do is to set up the config.yaml. This file is user-specific, and will tell cortex everything user-specific regarding data locations, visualation, and output locations. This helps your code in cortex be more distributable, as the overhead of dataset locations is handled here.

In order to get started, just run:

    $cortex setup

You will be prompted for several locations on your file system. Do not worry if you don't know the locations of all the datasets you wish to add. This can be re-run to add additional datasets.

### Usage

The first step is to check out cortex from the command line. Simply type:

    $ cortex --help

##### Arguments

    $cortex GAN --d.source CIFAR10 --d.copy_to_local

### Custom demos

While cortex has built-in functionality, but it is meant to meant to be used with your own modules. An example of making a model that works with cortex can be found at:
https://github.com/rdevon/cortex/blob/master/demos/demo_classifier.py
and
https://github.com/rdevon/cortex/blob/master/demos/demo_custom_ae.py

Documentation on the API can be found here:
https://github.com/rdevon/cortex/blob/master/cortex/plugins.py

For instance, the demo autoencoder can be used as:

    python cortex/demos/demo_custom_ae.py --help

### A walkthrough a custom classifier:

Let's look a little more closely at the autoencoder demo above to see what's going on. cortex relies on using and overriding methods of plugins classes.

First, let's look at the methods, `build`, `routine`, and `visualize`. These are special methods for the plugin that can be overridden to change the behavior of your model for your needs.

The signature of these functions look like:

```
    def build(self, dim_z=64, dim_encoder_out=64):
        ...

    def routine(self, inputs, targets, ae_criterion=F.mse_loss):
        ...

    def visualize(self, inputs, targets):
        ...
```

Each of these functions have arguments and keyword arguments. Note that the keyword arguments showed up in the help in the above example. This is part of the functionality of cortex: it manages your hyperparameters to these functions, organizes them, and provides command line control automatically. Even the docstrings are used in the command line, so other users can get the usage docs directly from there.

The arguments are *data*, which are to be manipulated as needed in those methods. These are for the most part handled automatically, but all of these methods can be used as normal functions as well.

#### Building models

The `build` function takes the hyperparameters and sets networks.

```

class Autoencoder(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, encoder, decoder):
        super(Autoencoder, self).__init__()
        self.encoder = encoder
        self.decoder = decoder

    def forward(self, x, nonlinearity=None):
        encoded = self.encoder(x)
        decoded = self.decoder(encoded)
        return decoded

...

    def build(self, dim_z=64, dim_encoder_out=64):
        encoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(28, 256),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            nn.Linear(256, 28),
            nn.ReLU(True))
        decoder = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(28, 256),
            nn.ReLU(True),
            nn.Linear(256, 28),
            nn.Sigmoid())
        self.nets.ae = Autoencoder(encoder, decoder)
```

All that's being done here is the hyperparameters are being used to create an instance of an `nn.Module` subclass, which is being added to the set of "nets". Note that they keyword `ae` is very important, as this is going to be how you retrieve your nets and define their losses farther down.

Also note that cortex *only* currently supports `nn.Module` subclasses from Pytorch.

### Defining losses and results

Adding losses and results from your model is easy, just compute your graph given you models and data, then add the losses and results by setting those members:

```
    def routine(self, inputs, targets, ae_criterion=F.mse_loss):
        encoded = self.nets.ae.encoder(inputs)
        outputs = self.nets.ae.decoder(encoded)
        r_loss = ae_criterion(
            outputs, inputs, size_average=False) / inputs.size(0)
        self.losses.ae = r_loss
```

Additional results can be added similarly. For instance, in the demo classifier:

```
    def routine(self, inputs, targets, criterion=nn.CrossEntropyLoss()):
        ...
        classifier = self.nets.classifier

        outputs = classifier(inputs)
        predicted = torch.max(F.log_softmax(outputs, dim=1).data, 1)[1]

        loss = criterion(outputs, targets)
        correct = 100. * predicted.eq(
            targets.data).cpu().sum() / targets.size(0)

        self.losses.classifier = loss
        self.results.accuracy = correct
```

### Visualization

Cortex allows for visualization using visdom, and this can be defined in a similar way as above:

```
    def visualize(self, images, inputs, targets):
        predicted = self.predict(inputs)
        self.add_image(images.data, labels=(targets.data, predicted.data),
                       name='gt_pred')
```

See the ModelPlugin API for more more details.

### Putting it together

Finally, we can specify default arguments:

```
    defaults = dict(
        data=dict(
            batch_size=dict(train=64, test=64), inputs=dict(inputs='images')),
        optimizer=dict(optimizer='Adam', learning_rate=1e-4),
        train=dict(save_on_lowest='losses.ae'))
```

and then add `cortex.main.run` to `__main__`:

```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    autoencoder = AE()
    run(model=autoencoder)
```

And that's it. cortex also allows for lower-level functions to be overridden (e.g., train_step, eval_step, train_loop, etc) with more customizability coming soon. For more examples of usage, see the built-in models: https://github.com/rdevon/cortex/tree/master/cortex/built_ins/models
