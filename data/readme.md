# Converting fmri dataset into tfrecord file

# Introduction
This is a tutorial on converting resting state fmri data from the dataset called ABIDE (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange)[1], into more accessible tfrecords file format. A consortium of the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI), ABIDE is a collaboration of 16 international imaging sites that have aggregated and are openly sharing neuroimaging data from 539 individuals suffering from ASD and 573 typical controls.[2]
